## What is an Emmet?

### Difference between Framework and Library
    Library: 1- There is no set of rules which we have to follow
             2- We can call any component any where we have the inversion of control on the code
             3- These are more flexible we can pick any library which we can use in any where 
             4- Libraries tend to have a lower learning curve, as you can use specific functions or classes independently in your code.

## What is CDN.Why we use it?
    CDN - CDN stands for Content delivery network. Let say we have a server in some other country and we are trying to access it from some other country where server is not located. so when we try to access the data from the server which is not presnt in the same country where usere is making the request to the serever. when user makes a request it will take some time to get the data because the servers are in different countries so it may take some time to get the data. To overcome this issuse what we do is we put our server in cloud in different location so that when user makes a request it hits the nearest server which is present near to the user and gets the data from the server. this won't take much time .

    why we use CDN
        1- Faster deliver network
        2- Improved Website performance
        3- Load Balancing - it distributes the request call
        4- Security- Many CDNs offer security features, including DDoS protection, web application firewalls, and other security measures. These features help protect websites and applications from malicious traffic and threats

## Why React is know as React?

    ReactDOM: ReactDOM is a library that focuses on rendering React components in a web browser. It is responsible for the integration of React with the Document Object Model (DOM) and provides the necessary methods for updating the browser's view based on changes in the React component tree.

## Difference between React.development.js and React.production.js?
    React.Development.js -  is used during development and debugging. It includes extra warnings and error messages, which can be helpful for identifying and diagnosing issues in your code during development.
    
    React.production.js is meant for use in a production environment, where optimizing for performance and minimizing file size is crucial. It is the version of React you should use when deploying your application for real users
