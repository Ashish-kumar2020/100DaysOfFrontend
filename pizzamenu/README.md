## Components

    -- Components are the building blocks in react
    -- Everything in react is made of components
    -- React renders the view for each components and make up the user interface
    -- Each component has its own data,logic,and appearance
    -- We build complex ui by building multiple compnents and combining them

### React only return a single element unless we wrap the components into fragments
